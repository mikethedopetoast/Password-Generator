### Challenges

- Challenge: Switching between themes
- Solution: Assign all relevant elements with the same class, store them in a variable, and change the CSS styles through Javascript

```
checkbox.addEventListener('change', () => {
    // change the theme of the website
    const lightTheme = document.getElementsByClassName('light-theme')
    for (let i = 0; i < lightTheme.length; i++) {
         lightTheme[i].classList.toggle('dark-theme')
         }
})
```
